# Weeb Games

Initially there are 3 blokchain games. The classic **Flip a Coin**, **Bim Bam Bom** and **Roll a Dice** games.

## How games work?

The winners share the losers bets.

The winning outcome is randomly set after each placed bet. That way the player knows beforehand which outcome is going to win if no more bets are placed and has an option to change the winning outcome by placing a new bet until the end of the game.
Since every new bet resets the winning outcome players compete with eachother to set the final winning outcome to be the one they have maximum interest.

Multiple bets to different outcomes can be placed.
