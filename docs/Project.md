## What existing problem does Weeb Finance solve?

Weeb Finance creates the easiest form of passive income generation model in the least energy consuming and safest way possible.

With many existing projects the learning curve of making an investment is high. Studying the details of each protocol takes time where most investors don't want to spare.
Weeb Finance solves this by integrating staking and yield farming inside the WEEB Token itself.

That simple action creates the following primary benefits;

Your investment generates yield simply by staying in your wallet.
1. Since, your tokens are in your wallet you're no longer exposed to a second party risk by which comes with sending your tokens to a staking or yield farming contract (giving up the ownership). Yield generation happens while your funds are in your wallet.
1. Since all required is a wallet you no longer need to iterract with project web sites to manage your investment. Unabling to reach the web site is not an issue.
